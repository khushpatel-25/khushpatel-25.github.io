    <p><img src="f1image.jpg" alt="Image of F1 cars" style="width: 400px;position:absolute;right: 260px;">The sport I've watched most recently has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One" target="_blank">Formula 1</a>. I first came across motorsports when I was 10, through MotoGP.<br>
    A few years later I was introduced to Formula 1 and was immediately hooked. I was baffled by the engineering brilliance of the teams <br>    
    and how they strived to squeeze every single bit of performance from their cars, as well as upgrading their cars through aerodynamic<br>and chassis related changes. Below is a table of some of my favourite teams and their respective drivers</p>
